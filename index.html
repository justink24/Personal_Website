            <h2 class="bio-title">Professional and Academic Career</h2>
            <p class="bio-text">I am a senior at Texas A&M studying computing.  I am also pursuing a <a href="https://mays.tamu.edu/ms-finance/">masters in finace</a> and is where I want to go more in my academic career.  I will be completing one year of a masters in finance during the fall 2024 and spring 2025 semesters.  During this time I will also be working to pass all the <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa#:~:text=A%20Chartered%20Financial%20Analyst%20(CFA,portfolio%20management%2C%20and%20wealth%20planning.">CFA Levels</a>.  I am planning on taking the CFA level 1 in February 2024, level 2 November 2024 and level 3 either may or August 2025.  I have previously worked as a software engineer for L3 Harris in greenville texas.  I worked for 7 months during a co-op there and worked mainly on operating systems for the plane.  Although this was a great experience I decided I didnâ€™t want to return and wanted to try a career in finance more than software engineering.  I think my computer science knowledge can help me in this career due to it becoming more and more data heavy.  Also my programming skills can help me automate tasks and become more of an efficiency worker.  Also the skill of learning on your own and figuring out problems that you develop as a computer scientist will help in my career as well.  </p>

            <h2 class="bio-title">Outside Interests</h2>
            <p class="bio-text">I am interested in many different sports.  I would say my biggest interests are NBA, college football and Golf.  I am from Dallas and therefore am a big Maverick fan.  For College football I am obviously a big A&M fan even though they often leave me disappointed.  For golf I am a fan of Scottie Scheffler and Jordan Speith.  My favorite sport to play nowadays is golf despite me not being the best.  I also am interested in financial markets which I like to keep up on and analyze different companies.  I also enjoy playing multiple board games like <a href="https://www.secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf">Secret Hitler</a> or 42. </p>
